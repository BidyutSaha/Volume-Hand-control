# Hand-Volume-Control
In this project I have built an OpenCV application in which a user can control his system's (laptop/pc) volume by making
some Hand Gestures.<br>
In this basically I explored Hand Tracking with the help of MediaPipe

### Demo :

### Main Libs Used :
- OpenCV (for image processing and drawing)
- Mediapipe (for Hand Tracking)
- Pycaw (to link up with the system's volume)
